## 🛠️ Contents of the Repository

The repository includes the following:

1. **Packet Tracer Files (`.pkt`)**
   - Configurations for various network topologies.
   - Simulations covering topics like VLANs, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and more.

2. **Documentation**
   - Step-by-step setup and configuration guides for each topology.
   - Explanation of the network design and protocols implemented.

3. **Supporting Files**
   - Diagrams of network architectures (where applicable).
   - Configuration commands and scripts in text format.
